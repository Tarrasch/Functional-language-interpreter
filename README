My interpreter:

	* Uses call by need using IORefs
	* Does do textual lookups, not Bruindin indices.
	* Carries one global (constant) and one local environment
	* Is tested by an automatic test suite:
		 The suite is stolen from lab3. How to run it and what it
		 produces is recorded in the Transcript file
		 (Running it manually is recommended so you get colors)
